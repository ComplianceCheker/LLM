"5","Mapping the GDPR to a Privacy Policy Corpus Annotation Scheme","https://usableprivacy.org/data ","In Article 5, the GDPR details a set of principles for data processing, which provide an overview of the regulation’s expectations for data controllers and processors. We compare these principles to the categories of OPP-115, which represent the most general level of the annotation scheme, and identify thematic connections. These connections represent instances when the principles and categories codify the same expectations (prescriptive and descriptive, respectively) for the contents of privacy policies. We also create a dataset of the connections between the 99 articles of the GDPR and the categories of OPP-115."
